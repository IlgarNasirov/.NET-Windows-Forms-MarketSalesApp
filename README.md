This is a market sales desktop project. There are admin and seller roles. The admins can do all CRUD operations on products and sellers and follow all sales. The 
sellers can do all CRUD operations on products which located in the checkout. Then, they can sell them. The seller can also print receipt of sales. I used 
ADO.NET(for connecting database) and Microsoft SQL Server(as database).
